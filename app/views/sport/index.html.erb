<p>Mostly down to Mr Perkins, I've decided to give my predictions online. And some betting tips.</p>
<p>This means that I'm now going to absolutely suck this season but here goes...</p>

<p>All odds are based on Bet365 at time of writing.</p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>BAD week. I mean, really bad. How were Atlanta so bad and the Bills so good. And the Colts just didn't bother trying. Saved a bit by the late games. I guess the first week is always the hardest, no real form to go on.</p>
<p>Would have been nice if SD won by one less. Cam Newton was awesome, except the final red-zone attempt.</p>
<p>In terms of Picks against the Spread: 7-8.</p>

<p>Assuming a £1 bet on each bet and £5 each on bankers (with £1 accumulator): 57p loss all together:</p>


<p><strong>PIT @ BAL</strong> Definately the matchup of the week. If I was picking a winner I'd go Steelers, but not with much confidence. Better bet is Total Points Over 36. Both teams have a dcent QB, who can put up points and I can't see either team scoring less than 2 TDs. That just leaves 8 points from somewhere. Defence could get this, failing that FGs.
  <br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">PIT (2.05)</span>, <span class="right">over 36 (1.9)</span>. <span class="wrong">Special Team or Defensive TD - Yes 2.5</span> 
</br>
<span class="wrong">Loss £1.10</span></p>
<p><strong>CIN @ CL</strong>E	Probably the worst game of the week, if not the season. Two of the worst teams in the league. I've got to go for the Browns, just because I like their young QB, McCoy
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">CLE -6.5</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £1.00</span></p>
<p><strong>IND @ HOU</strong>	Peyton Manning is out. That sucks. How many are the Texans going to win by is the question here. This is probably the Colt fan speaking but I think the Colts keep it close, with a big game for Addai because Collins ain't gonna do anything.
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">IND + 9.0 (1.9). Joseph Addai to score a TD at any time (1.9)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £2.00</span>
</p><p><strong>TEN @ JAC</strong>	Both Teams are heavy runners so it'll come down to a battle between MoJo and hris Johnson. I reckon Jones-Drew wins this one and the Jags pound out a win
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">JAC -1 (1.86) Under 37 (1.9)</span>
<br/><span class="right">Profit £1.76</span>
</p><p><strong>BUF @ KC</strong>	Buffalo Suck. Their offence suck. Their defence suck.
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">KC - 5.5 (1.9)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £1.00</span>

</p><p><strong>ATL @ CHI</strong>	Going to go out on a limb here and say Atlanta do well here, I just like Their high powered offence. Matt Ryan is a quality QB and will pick on the Bears' average CBs. Look for Roddy White to have a big game
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £1.00</span>
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">ATL -2.0 (1.9) ATL -6.5 (2.65), Roddy White to score a TD (1.9). Scorecast: White first TD scorer, ATL by 7-12 (36.0)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £4.00</span>
</p><p><strong>DET @ TB</strong>	Two teams both improving year on year. Think both of these will finish 8-8 this year so I'm gonna take a Punt on Detroit
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">DET (2.05)</span>
<br/><span class="right">Profit £1.05</span>
</p><p><strong>PHI @ STL</strong>	I like St Louis this year. Unfortuately, they're up against the "Dream Team". The Eagles have so many new faces, I'm hoping they haven't had time to gel yet
<br/>
<strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong">STL +4.0 (1.9)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £1.00</span>
</p>


<p><strong>NYG @ WAS</strong>	Usually I'd go for the Giants in this one, especially with Grossman calling the shots for Washington. However, the Giants D is banged up and patched together. Still think the Giants take it but not by much
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">WAS +3.0 (1.8)</span>
<br/><span class="right">Profit £0.80</span>
</p><p><strong>CAR @ AR</strong>I	The Panthers have a rookie QB, Cam Newton, starting. He'll hold his own in the first half, but will mostly be handing off to DeAngelo Williams and Jonathon Stewart. The Cards will go up early and the pressue will get to Cam as he has to catchup in a hostile environment and he won't.
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">ARI -6.5 (1.86)</span>
<br/><span class="right">Profit £0.86</span>
</p><p><strong>SEA @ SF</strong>	The 49ers have to come good eventually. I think this may be their year, and what a nice game to get starter with. They win by a TD
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">SF -5.5 (1.9).</span><span class="wrong"> Hcap Tie with SEA +7 (12.0)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £0.10</span>
</p><p><strong>MIN @ SD</strong>	I think the bookies have this one wrong. 9 points is way to much to give Minnesota. Yeah, the Chargers win, but by less than a TD
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">MIN +9.0 (1.9)</span>.<span class="wrong">SD by 1-6 (5.5)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £0.10</span>
</p><p><strong>DAL @ NYJ</strong>	Good game. The return of Romo will make this fun to watch. Can America's team pull off an upset on National TV? Nah.
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="wrong>">NYJ -5.5 (1.9)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Loss £1.00</span>
</p><p><strong>NE @ MIA</strong>	How many TDs will Tom Brady throw? 3? 4? 7? Something like that. Is there something I don't know?
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="right">NE -6.5 (1.86) NE -13.5 (2.7)</span>
<br/><span class="right">Profit £2.56</span>
</p><p><strong>OAK @ DEN</strong>	What a crap game for MNF. Both Teams suck. The Broncos are slightly better, having retained the star on Defence.
<br/>
  <strong>Bets: </strong><span class="pending">DEN -3.0 (1.83)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Losss £1.00</span>
</p>
<p>I'm also gonna chose 5 or 6 'bankers' each week. These won't be 'bankers' in the true sense of the word but ones I have more confidence in.  This week:</p>
<p>
  <br/><span class="right">PIT-BAL Over 36: 1.9 (Profit £4.50)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">Joseph Addai to score a TD: 1.9 (Loss £5.00)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">ATL(-2.0) to beat CHI: 1.9 (Loss £5.00)</span>
<br/><span class="right">MIN(+9.0) to beat SD: 1.9 (Profit £4.50)</span>
<br/><span class="right">NE(-6.5) to beat MIA: 1.86 (Profit 4.30)</span>
<br/><span class="right">SF(-5.5) to beat SEA: 1.9 (Profit £4.50)</span>
<br/><span class="wrong">6 FOLD ~ 46/1 (Loss £1.00)</span>
</p>
